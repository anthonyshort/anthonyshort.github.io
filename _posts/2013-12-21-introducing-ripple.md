First, some history:

Automatic DOM binding is the cool thing to do these days. We're sick of having to manually touch DOM nodes like a chump. We've got libraries like React, Ractive, Reactive and Rivets (sensing a theme here?) that all do a similar thing. They take a model, write it's attributes to the DOM using a template and then listen for changes on the model.
