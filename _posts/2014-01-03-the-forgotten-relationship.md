Not so long ago there existed books for reading, albums for listening, diaries for planning, and paper for notes.

At some point we thought it would be nice not having to carry all of this around with us so we boxed it all up, removed it from our homes and kept it on a hard drive.

We changed the way technology was used in our daily life. Instead of having something that did one thing well we had something that did everything at once.

Life was grand.

Then suddenly we lost the relationship we had with the objects that we grew up with. The ones that shape our memories. The magic faded away and was replaced by simple efficiency.

We neglected the joy our senses get from the little things.

Soon we were left with no memories of books or music. We couldn't remember what albums we were listening to through that bad break up or where we were when we finished that book that changed our lives. We forgot about the smell of a new book as we open it in quiet chair in the corner of the room draped over by the soft light of a lamp.

Instead we opened iBooks, watched TV and listened to music - all at the same time.

Then we started to wonder why we were finding it so hard to switch off. We never gave ourselves time to forget about everything else except the thing we're doing. When we're finished with something, instead of putting it on the shelf and out of mind, we kept it all together never giving our mind a chance to be clear.

We lost the ability to focus. We used phones, tablets and computers, tools that are associated with many other tasks, and we forgot how to switch off and enjoy doing one thing at a time.

Our homes were lacking the warmth that comes from an environment filled with memories.

In our rush for technology to simplify life we managed to make it more complicated than it needed to be.

When you have a hammer everything looks like a nail.
